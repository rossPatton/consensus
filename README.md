# Consensus
-- TODO fill me out

# First Time
Run 3 commands in order to get the dev server running:
- make setup
- make install
- make dev

Init the nginx proxy so that you can access consensus.local locally
This network should be run in detached mode and will automatically restart with docker for mac
- cd /nginx
- docker-compose up -d

You're good to go!
